## About Berilium

>>> **What is Berilium?**
Berilium is a financial technology company that offers private market portfolios geared toward long term investors.

Berilium offers access to top private market investments which have historically been reserved for institutions and the ultra-wealthy. A plug-and-invest solution to your existing portfolio so you can gain low-cost and low-minimum diversified exposure to private markets.
>>>

>>> **Why own Private Market investments?**
Private market investments are a core component of professional investors’ portfolios as they provide portfolio diversification, have higher return potential, and serve as a portfolio ballast when public markets are volatile.
>>>

>>> **What is Berilium’s mission?**
Berilium’s mission is to evolve your existing investment portfolio with private market opportunities. We created Berilium to make private market investing affordable, transparent, and efficient.
>>>

>>> **How can Berilium improve my existing portfolio?**
By answering a few questions, we will automatically build a custom portfolio based on your goals.

Berilium provides investors with exposure to diversified private market portfolios with low fees and low investment minimums.

Traditionally, individual retail investors are limited to investing in public stocks and bonds, while institutional and ultra-high net worth investors have access to private market assets and thus, consistently outperform retail investors.
>>>

>>> **Can I invest in private markets myself?**
You will typically need to invest over $5MM to reproduce the same type of investment portfolios that through Berilium you can access at low minimums. Berilium provides exclusive access to private market assets that retail investors simply can't obtain on their own.

## Investing

>>>**What are the types of investments offered by Berilium?**
Berilium invests in private market opportunities across asset classes such as private equity, venture capital, private credit, and real estate. These can include heterogeneous investments that range from owning shares in a pre-IPO company, to participating in the origination of a privately negotiated credit facility and other methods of sourcing access to private market opportunities.

These investment opportunities can be combined to generate income and/or growth-oriented portfolios.
>>>

>>> **What kind of financial objectives can Berilium help me achieve?**
Berilium allows your portfolio a greater chance of success by providing portfolio diversification, higher return potential, and consistency of returns in periods of market volatility.

Opportunities in private markets are combined to achieve your financial objectives. These can go from generating income and distributions, to compounding wealth.
>>>

>>> **What am I investing in?**
When you invest in Berilium portfolios, you are acquiring shares in private market funds that are run by third-party firms and invest in private market assets. Each of those funds tends to have a relatively narrow focus; we combine them in a way that generates the return profile that is right for you.

The underlying assets that you own and the funds you invest in are managed by some of the largest and most reputable private investment firms such as Blackstone, KKR and Ares to name a few.

Through Berilium portfolios, we currently have access to over 30 different private market investment strategies that we can combine into a portfolio for you.
>>>

>>> **What is the typical investment in my portfolio?**
We only include top-tier funds with a track record of success and that have gone through our diligence process. Most of the funds offered have over $1B in assets under management and in many cases are managed by marquee firms such as Blackstone, KKR and Ares.
>>>

>>> **How does Berilium gain access to high-quality private market funds?**
Through our relationships given our experience in the industry as well as by representing the aggregated capital from individual investors.  Berilium can access opportunities typically reserved to institutional investors and ultra-high net worth individuals.
>>>

>>>**What type of diligence do you conduct on the investment opportunities offered?**
Each opportunity that is offered has to go through a rigorous underwriting and approval process. That includes investment due diligence by thoroughly analyzing track records, investment strategy thesis, portfolio construction, team, and other qualitative indicators such as industry references. In addition, we conduct operational due diligence which assesses risk management, operational suitability, and compliance, legal and regulatory risk. This is the same type of work that the Berilium team members have conducted in the past to manage the capital of large institutional investors. We cannot guarantee future performance, but we are fully committed and aligned with your success.
>>>

>>>**How liquid are my investments with Berilium?**
We aim to offer repurchases on a quarterly basis starting after the first anniversary post-investment. However, there is no guarantee of short-term liquidity. Berilium portfolios are meant and should be considered long-term investments where the capital is returned over several years.
